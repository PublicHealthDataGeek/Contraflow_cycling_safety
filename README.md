### Abstract
Contraflow cycling on one-way streets is a low cost intervention that research shows can
improve the cycling experience and increase participation. Evidence from several studies
suggest that cyclists on contraflows have a lower crash risk. However, implementing contraflow
cycling is often controversial, including in the United Kingdom (UK). In this paper we examine
whether contraflow cycling on one-way streets alters crash or casualty rates for pedal cyclists.  

Focusing on inner London boroughs between 1998 and 2019, we identified 508 road segments
where contraflow cycling was introduced on one-way streets. We identified road traffic crashes
occurring within 10m of these segments and labelled them as pre-contraflow, contraflow or
contraflow removed crashes. We calculated rates using the number of crashes or casualties
divided by the time exposed and generated 95% confidence intervals using bootstrap
resampling. We adjusted the rates for changes in cordon cycling volume and injury severity
reporting.  

There were 1498 crashes involving pedal cyclists: 788 pre-contraflow, 703 contraflow and 7
following contraflow removal. There was no change in adjusted overall crash rates or pedal
cyclist casualty rates when contraflow cycling was introduced. Proximity to a junction doubled
the crash rate. The crash rate when pedal cyclists were travelling contraflow was the same as
those travelling with flow.  

We have found no evidence that introducing contraflow cycling increases the crash or casualty
rate for pedal cyclists. It is possible that such rates may indeed fall when contraflow cycling is
introduced if more accurate spatio-temporal cycling volume data was available. We recommend
all one-way streets are evaluated for contraflow cycling but encourage judicious junction design and recommend UK legislative change for mandatory two-way cycling on one-way streets unless exceptional circumstances exist.
